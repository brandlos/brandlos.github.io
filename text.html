                <h2>Big Lug</h2>
                <p><small>(published in Nicolas' <em>Zzzine</em>, May 2017)</small></p>
                <p>Every day, I imagine what if I were beautiful, but I wash it off instead. Mercedes is, and when she appeared she helped to root the burning bush plucked from my grandmother's old estate—from her apartment. She makes it a rule to whip out all her charms and her niceties, one by one. She did it today as always. Her hairstyle is sweeping and precise for this purpose, anyway.</p>
                <p>I've never had a knack for a long haul like that.</p>
                <p>Down in the plot, there was a ceramic spade I intended to shove into the nearest closed earth crack. I keep an hour of every day to devote to putting up or knocking out things that will regrow—to some maintenance. Two of Mercedes' friends came to bang out the bush. I think it's easier to approach Cilio first with my great expectations, so I took his hand greedily.</p>
                <p>"There aren't thorns but you'll need to pretend it can hurt you," I said.</p>
                <p>"Show me the spot," he said. I said it was out back and that was the plan.</p>
                <p>At night Cilio lives a town further out. I live in Wall. He lives in Brick. He squatted to inspect that loamy tract and I had a burning thought.</p>
                <p>A good misstep is what comes in or out of it again at any cost for once. For good. I could have.</p>
                <p>But it's Clyde who took up the rear position while I stood there, gutted. I promise it's not on purpose. The hedge ambled sidelong by me.</p>
                <p>The bush has berries that you shouldn't eat. They're fertilized by some shit. In my fantasy I'd be better enough to negotiate my fingers into a shape that could fondle those and they are what I would have carried.</p>

                <h2>Refrain</h2>
                <p>
                    The way she walks?—she has a stubby stride.<br/>
                    I try my best not to do it, though<br/>
                    I like the prenatal lull of that trot,<br/>
                    though a working substitution of that
                </p>
                <p>
                    woman could be you, too, owing to<br/>
                    my usual tendency to match up with<br/>
                    whoever makes a quiet nook for me.<br/>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Settling into the grooves of someone.<br/>
                    I think I have a fluid foundation.<br/>
                    Anyway, I condense. There's too many<br/>
                </p>
                <p>
                    and things get all kinds of clung to me.<br/>
                    Pebbles and twigs fermenting in a brine.<br/>
                    The people living here are rapid-fire.<br/>
                </p>
                <p>
                    My brain is thrumming enough to lift<br/>
                    me out of this, so I get to hoisting.<br/>
                    I'm talking big. I'm somewhere or other,<br/>
                </p>
                <p>
                    but you're here. I have to try out the<br/>
                    other side before I can decide where<br/>
                    I ought to be. But, now, where should I be?<br/>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I can't say. I can't say. I can't say.<br/>
                    I can't say. I can't say. I can't say.<br/>
                    I can't say. I can't say. I can't say.<br/>
